# OpenglLearning

# How do I approach designing software?
I think about what I wish to make and think about the basic things I will first need.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
It has helped me learn to appropriately map the textures to certain parts of 
the gpu to make it render how i want texture coordinates and other data to be rendered

# What design process did you follow for your project work?
my desing of the software came through necessity. So I did not develop something until it was needed 

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I could learn to structure all the needed functions together first, 
write them out with their tests, and then implement it into the source code 
to ensure the proper functionality I want is applied

# How do I approach developing programs?
Same as I do software

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Exact same test driven style of development

# How did iteration factor into your development?
it was important in making sure that I had what I needed as far as correct data goes.

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  I have gotten better at thinking about solutions and creating them and testing them and see if it works and if not move on to a new possible solution.
  
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  It has kept me striving to learn
  
# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  I must continue studying my mathematics which will surely benefit in both my education and professional pathways.
  
# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  It has allowed me to be a bit creative in the computer science side more than can be often said it is.
